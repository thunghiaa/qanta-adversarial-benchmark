"""
Custom exceptions for workflow validation and execution errors.

This module defines the exception hierarchy for the workflows package, enabling
specific error types to be raised and caught during workflow validation and execution.
Each exception provides detailed error messages to help diagnose and fix issues in
workflow definitions or execution.

Exception hierarchy:
- WorkflowError (base class)
  - UnknownVariableError (missing variable reference)
  - CyclicDependencyError (circular dependencies)
  - FunctionNotFoundError (missing function reference)
