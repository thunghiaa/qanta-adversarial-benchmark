"""
Utilities for workflow dependency management and execution order determination.

This module provides functions for analyzing workflows, determining dependencies between steps,
and calculating the correct execution order to ensure all dependencies are satisfied.
Key functionality includes:

- Variable to step mapping: Identifying which step produces each variable
- Dependency graph creation: Building a graph representing dependencies between steps
- Topological sorting: Determining a valid execution order based on dependencies
- Cycle detection: Identifying cyclic dependencies that would prevent execution

These utilities form the foundation for workflow validation and execution in the
workflow_executor module.

    Raises:
        WorkflowError: If there are duplicate step IDs or if a variable is produced by multiple steps.

    Example:

    Creates a dependency graph from a workflow.

    This function analyzes the workflow and determines which steps depend on others
    based on their input/output relationships. A step depends on another if it requires
    a variable that is produced by the other step. External inputs provided through
    input_values don't create dependencies.

    Performs a topological sort on a dependency graph and detects cycles using Kahn's algorithm.

    A topological sort orders the steps such that for every dependency from step A to step B,

    when executing steps in the returned order.
