"""
Core workflow execution functionality.

This module handles the execution of defined workflows, including input processing,
dependency-based execution order, model calling, and output collection. It integrates
with the litellm library to handle model interactions.

Key components:
- Utility functions for input/output transformation
- Input processing and validation
- Model step execution with support for log probabilities
- Complete workflow execution with dependency resolution
- Support for both simple (single-step) and multi-step workflows
- Structured output collection with intermediate results

The module orchestrates the execution of steps in the correct order based on their
dependencies and manages the flow of data between steps. It supports:
- Full content tracking for debugging
- Log probability calculation for specific steps
- Flexible input/output transformations
- Error handling and validation

    Runs example workflows demonstrating key functionality and error handling.

    This function creates and executes three different example workflows to showcase:

    1. Successful workflow execution:
       - A linear two-step workflow with proper dependency flow
       - Input transformation using the 'upper' function
       - Output transformation using the 'lower' function
       - Proper variable passing between steps

    2. Cyclic dependency detection:
       - A workflow with two steps that depend on each other circularly
       - Demonstrates the error handling for cyclic dependencies
       - Shows how the system prevents infinite execution loops

    3. Unknown variable detection:
       - A workflow that references a variable not provided as input or by any step
       - Demonstrates validation of variable references
       - Shows error handling for missing dependencies

    Each example prints its result or the error encountered, making this function
    useful for testing and demonstration purposes.

    Returns:
        None: This function prints its results and doesn't return a value.
